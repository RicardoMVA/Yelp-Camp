/* this creates the keyframes for the animation */
/* 
		From 0% to 10% (the beginning of our animation) the list item 
		begins changing it's opacity from 0 to 1 (invisible to visible)
		
		the animation-timing-function is set to ease-in at 0% and 
		ease-out and 10%, this makes for a more smooth fade-in 
	 
		The list item's opacity then stays at 1 until it reaches 20% 
		at which point it fades back out, reaching 0 at 30% and staying 
		at 0 for the remainder of the animation
	 
		If we have 5 background images visible for 5 seconds each, 
		then the time it takes to fade the image in and keep it visible 
		is 10 seconds with a 5 second crossfade/fadeout into the next 
		image; The entire animation cycle for all 5 images takes 50 
		seconds total
		
		100% divided by 5 is 20% so each image's fadein and visibility 
		should last 20% of the cycle; half of 20% is 10%, that is why 
		our fade in is from 0% to 10%, then we keep it visible until 
		20% is reached and begin the fadeout from 20% to 30%, the 5 
		second fadeout overlaps the next image's 5 second fadein, 
		which is what creates the crossfade effect
