<h1>Yelp-Camp</h1>
<p>This is a heavily refactored, slightly modified version of the YelpCamp site, which is done at the end of the Colt Steele's <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Web Developer Bootcamp course</a> from Udemy.</p>

<p>Check the version deployed on heroku <a href="https://yelpcamp-ricardo.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Notable changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of Webpack and Babel for cutting-edge JavaScript;</li>
<li>Different UI, since the course only leads into a very basic look;</li>
<li>Storing images locally, since cloudinary is potentially a limiting/bottleneck factor;</li>
<li>Compressing and resizing uploaded images with 'sharp' npm module, for optimized site performance and storage;</li>
<li>Uniform display of images in the index page using plain CSS, to make the grid symmetric;</li>
</ul>
<p>Also did most of the optional changes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pricing of campgrounds;</li>
<li>Google maps location (you must provide your own API keys);</li>
<li>Time since campground was created, using Moment JS;</li>
<li>Administrator account/role;</li>
<li>User profile;</li>
<li>Password resetting using Gmail (you must provide your own API keys);</li>
<li>Searching campgrounds in index page;</li>
<li>Uploading images (locally, not using cloudinary);</li>
<li>Migration to Bootstrap 4</li>
</ul>

<p>Todo's:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure corresponding comments get deleted when deleting a campground;</li>
<li>Allow user to upload profile image;</li>
<li>Make small/thumbnail copy of campground image, so that main campgrounds page becomes faster;</li>
<li>Lazy loading and/or pagination in main campgrounds page</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running the project:</h2>
<p>Install Node.JS, NPM package manager, and the project zip file. In the project root folder, run 'npm install', then 'npm start'.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the entry point is the 'app-bundle.js' file - you can run it with 'node' command as-is.</p>
<p>Note that for local Database usage, you need MongoDB installed.</p>
